# Purpose
A project created for the course of Computational Intelligence in Aristotle Univeristy of Thessaloniki 
(Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering)

It implements a small regression model based on a Radial Basis Function (RBF) Layer and using the Boston Housing as the dataset.
The model architecture consists of the cascade: Input Layer -> RBF Layer -> Dense Intermediate Layer ->
-> Dropout Layer -> Ouput Layer/Neuron
